In this Lab, we'll enable Network Performance Monitoring in Storedog, a basic e-commerce application running in Docker. Storedog consists of the following services:

| Service        | Purpose |
| ---            |         |
| agent          | The Datadog Agent, which will collect metrics from all of the services and send them to the Datdog platform |
| discounts      | Python Flask API that serves store item discounts |
| frontend       | Spree, an open source e-commerce framework written in Ruby |
| advertisements | Python Flask API that serves advertisements |
| db             | PostgreSLQ database used by all services |

Let's take a look at the docker-compose configuration file to see how we enabled Network Monitoring for Storedog. Click on the IDE tab and give it several seconds to load. Then expand the `lab` directory and open the file `docker-compose.yml`.

NPM is enabled by configuring the Datadog Agent service, `agent`. This docker-compose file has already been configured according to the instructions in the [NPM Installation documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/network_performance_monitoring/installation/?tab=docker): 

  - Under `environment`, we added `DD_SYSTEM_PROBE_ENABLED=true`
  - Under `volumes`, we added `/sys/kernel/debug:/sys/kernel/debug`
  - We added the `cap_add` section to allow the container to access host resources
  - We added the `security_opt` section to avoid AppArmor restrictions

These elevated privileges are required because NPM relies on [eBPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter#Extensions_and_optimizations), a kernel-level interface to a Linux system's data link layer.

Configuring NPM on a host, Kubernetes, or ECS is similar, and covered in the NPM Installation documentation.

In the next step, we'll get familiar with the Storedog application and look at its network data in the Datadog App.
