Postman is a popular platform for creating, sharing, testing, and documenting HTTP APIs. Over the years it has accumulated many business-friendly features, but at its core it a an easy and powerful tool for making HTTP requests and analyzing their responses. 

Postman's Collection feature allows users to create a library of HTTP requests for an API's endpoints. This can be used like a functional reference guide that clearly documents the URLs, parameters, and payloads for each API endpoint. Datadog maintains the Datadog Collection for Postman, and you will use that in this lab to further explore the Datadog API.

This lab expects you to create a free Postman account. If you do not wish to create a Postman account, you can use alternatives such as the web-based Hoppscotch.io, or search the web for "popular rest api tools". You may not be able to use the Datadog Collection, but you will likely be able to recreate many of the same requests.
