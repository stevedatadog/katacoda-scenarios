In this course you'll take a hands-on tour of the Datadog API and its capabilities. You'll learn a variety of ways to communicate with the Datadog API with an emphasis on automation. You'll discover tools and techniques that can reduce your reliance on the Datadog UI, especially while provisioning new services.

You will start exploring the Datadog API using the Postman collection, and move through using curl, dogshell, client libraries, and finally Terraform to perform useful Datadog tasks.
