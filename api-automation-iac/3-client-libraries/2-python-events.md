## Creating events with Python

**TODO** same as as previous step but calling the Post an event endpoint.

## More about the Python library
Look at the [Python Client documentation](https://datadogpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to learn about its capabilities. It's one of the few libraries can communicate with both the Datadog API and [DogStatsD](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd), a metrics aggregation service bundled with the Datadog Agent. 

## Other languages
Take a look at the [list of client libraries](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/libraries/) to see what's available for your language of choice. Also note that there are many special purpose Datadog libraries, such as those for serverless, log management, Google Analytics, and even Jira to name a small set.
