Datadog offers many open source client libraries for communicating with the Datadog API in your applications. There are also many unofficial libraries to choose from. The Python library is mature, feature-rich, and a good example of a typical Datadog API library.

In this lab, you will examine and run Python scripts that use the official Datadog for Python library. You'll perform the same tasks you did from the command line, so you can see differences and similarities of doing so with a client library.
