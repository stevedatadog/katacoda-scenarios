There are many programming language libraries, called "[client libraries](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/community/libraries/)," that simplify communicating with the Datadog API. You can use them to easily add Datadog API requests to most applications, from internal administrative tools to native mobile consumer applications. Client libraries unlock the full power of the Datadog API using the programming languages that best fit your needs or preferences.

In this lab, you will examine and run Python scripts that use the two official python libraries. You'll perform the same tasks you did in previous labs, so you can see the differences and similarities of performing them with client libraries.
