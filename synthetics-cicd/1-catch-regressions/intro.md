In this lab you will learn about the three different types of Synthetics tests available in Datadog:

  1. API Tests
  2. Multi-step API Tests
  3. Browser Tests

You will create each of these tests to cover an important business function of Storedog, a small e-commerce application. You will configure these tests to run automatically and to alert staff when they fail. This will give the Storedog organization peace of mind as they continue to rapidly enhance and grow their application. 

Before you begin, check your email for an invitation to a new trial Datadog organization. It will contain a link that will log you in to the Datadog App. If you have already joined a Learning Center trial organization in the past couple of weeks, you will not receive a new invitation; you can continue using that trial organization.

When you are logged-in to your new trial organization in the Datadog App, click the **Start Scenario** button to get started.
