Great job creating Datadog Synthetics Tests to monitor Storedog's discounts service. Here are some of the skills you have acquired:

- You can create an HTTP API test to monitor the availability and performance of a web service
- You can create assertions in your tests to tune the pass/fail tolerances of HTTP status codes and response times
- You know how to read test results, including waterfall graphs
- You know how to link APM metrics to your synthetics tests
- You know how to test application functionality by creating regular expression and JSONPath assertions
- You can create a Multistep API test
- You can create Global Variables for use in all your tests and steps
- You can extract response values into variables for use in test steps
- You can create robust browser test to monitor important features of a web application's user interface
- You know how to use JavaScript to assign response values to variables
- You know how to make HTTP requests from within browser tests to validate important values

You now have a robust suite of tests that will boost your confidence that you'll quickly catch problems with the discounts service following deployments.

In the next half of this course, you will learn how to use the Datadog Synthetics API to automatically run tests as part of your CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions before your users see them.
