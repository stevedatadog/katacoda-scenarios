Congratulations on integrating a Datadog synthetic browser test into a CI/CD pipeline. Having completed the half of the course, you are now able to:

1. Call the Datadog API for synthetics directly to trigger a synthetic test using its public id
1. Call the Datadog API to to fetch results of synthetic tests using result ids
1. Use the `datadog-ci` command line client to run synthetic tests observe results
1. Run `datadog-ci` in a CI/CD pipeline to automatically trigger synthetic tests, and automatically halt the pipeline when tests fail

Put these skills to use and start integrating synthetic tests into your own pipeline. If you have any questions specifically about this course, reach out to [learn@datadoghq.com](mailto:learn@datadoghq.com), or drop into the #training channel of our [public Slack](https://datadoghq.slack.com/).
