Congratulations on integrating a Datadog synthetic browser test into a CI/CD pipeline. Having completed the half of the course, you are now able to:

<ul style="max-width: 75vw;  margin: auto;">
<li>Call the Datadog API for synthetics directly to trigger a synthetic test using its public id
<li>Call the Datadog API to to fetch results of synthetic tests using result ids
<li>Use the `datadog-ci` command line client to run synthetic tests observe results
<li>Run `datadog-ci` in a CI/CD pipeline to automatically trigger synthetic tests, and automatically halt the pipeline when tests fail
</ul>

Put these skills to use and start integrating synthetic tests into your own pipeline. If you have any questions specifically about this course, reach out to [learn@datadoghq.com](mailto:learn@datadoghq.com), or drop into the #training channel of our [public Slack](https://datadoghq.slack.com/).

**ONE MORE THING**: Please delete or at least pause any synthetic tests that you have created in this lab. They will continue to run, even if your trial account expires. Thank you!
