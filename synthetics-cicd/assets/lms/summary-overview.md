In this course, you'll learn how to incorporate Datadog's synthetic browser tests into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to minimize user-facing application regressions resulting from buggy releases.

We strongly recommend that you complete the Introduction to Synthetics course before starting this course, as it walks you through creating the browser test used in this course.
