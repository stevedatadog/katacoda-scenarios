About the Learning Environment
===
This lab uses an ephemeral virtual environment complete with a terminal and IDE. This is where you'll be configuring applications, running commands, and exploring the lab application. This lab also creates or reuses a trial Datadog organization for you so that you can safely explore the Datadog App in isolation of any other organizations you might already use.

At the bottom of this page, you will see a **username** and a **password**. These are the trial organization credentials that you should use to login to Datadog for this lab. You don't have to write them down now; we'll display them again inside the interactive lab.

Trial organizations expire every two weeks, but don't worry; we'll automatically create a new trial organization and credentials for you when that happens. This trial organization and its credentials will be reused for every lab in the Learning Center until it expires.
