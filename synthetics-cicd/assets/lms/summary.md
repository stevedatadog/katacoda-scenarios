Having completed this course, you are now able to:

- Create end-to-end tests to check that key functionalities of your application are functioning as expected
- Trigger on demand test runs using the API or the datadog-ci CLI
- Integrate Synthetic tests at the various stages of your CI/CD process to ensure faulty code does not make it to production
- Troubleshoot an issue in case of test failure using the collected screenshots, resources, and console errors

Put these skills to use and start integrating synthetic tests into your own pipeline. If you have any questions specifically about this course, reach out to [learn@datadoghq.com](mailto:learn@datadoghq.com), or drop into the #training channel of our [public Slack](https://datadoghq.slack.com/).
