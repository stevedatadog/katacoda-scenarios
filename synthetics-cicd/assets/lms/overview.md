Detailed Course Overview
===
Datadog makes it easy to observe your backend systems and applications out-of-the box. With a little configuration, you can observe your frontend services and applications, too.

In this course, you'll learn how to use Synthetic Monitoring to automatically test a web application's APIs and end-to-end frontend functionality. Then you'll learn how to incorporate these tests into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to minimize and even eliminate user-facing application regressions resulting from buggy releases.
