Congratulations on integrating a Datadog synthetic browser test into a CI/CD pipeline. Hopefully you have developed some ideas about how you can incorporate synthetic tests into your own build and deployment pipelines. 

**NOTE**: Please delete or at least pause any synthetic tests that you have created in this lab. Otherwise they will continue to run, even if your trial account expires. Thank you!
