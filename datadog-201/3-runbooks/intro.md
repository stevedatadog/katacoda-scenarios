In this lab you're going to create a runbook for troubleshooting and fixing problems with the Storedog checkout flow. This will be a valuable asset for devops and site reliability engineers when the checkout flow SLO misses its target. The runbook will be a notebook containing:

<ul style="max-width: 75vw;  margin: auto;">
  <li>A description of the runbook explaining when to use it 
  <li>Links to drill-down in to other Datadog resources
  <li>A top list of the most recent synthetic test results
  <li>A top list of running containers
  <li>Troubleshooting diagnostics and solutions for common problems
  <li>Inbound link from the executive dashboard 
</ul>
