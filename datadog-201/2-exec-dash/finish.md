In this lab you completed an extremely useful--and good looking--executive dashboard. You learned several techniques and shortcuts to accomplish this. You are now able to:
<ul style="max-width: 75vw;  margin: auto;">
  <li>Create an SLO monitor for a synthetic browser test and display its summary on a dashboard
  <li>Add handy drilldown links to other Datadog resources
  <li>Move, resize, group, and color code widgets in a dashboard
  <li>Use the quick nav to quickly find resources and navigate the Datadog app
</ul>

Hopefully, you thought of some useful and interesting dashboards that you can create in your own organization.
