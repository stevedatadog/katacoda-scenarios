In this lab you created an extremely useful--and good looking--executive dashboard. You learned several techniques and shortcuts to accomplish this. You are now able to:

- Copy widgets from between dashboards using the clipboard
- Create dashboard template variables for use in widget queries
- Set widget timeframes to fixed periods or to Global Time
- Create an SLO monitor for a synthetic browser test and display its summary on a dashboard
- Move, resize, group, and color code widgets in a dashboard

Hopefully thought of some useful and interesting dashboards that you can create in your own organization.
