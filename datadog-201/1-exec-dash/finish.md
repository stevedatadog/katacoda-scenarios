In this lab you created an extremely useful--and good looking--executive dashboard. You learned several techniques and shortcuts to accomplish this. You are now able to:
<ul style="max-width: 75vw;  margin: auto;">
  <li>Copy widgets from between dashboards using the clipboard
  <li>Create dashboard template variables for use in widget queries
  <li>Set widget timeframes to fixed periods or to global time
  <li>Export dashboards as JSON
</ul>

Click the **Continue** button to further customize the executive dashboard by adding an SLO, drilldowns, and some visual appeal.
