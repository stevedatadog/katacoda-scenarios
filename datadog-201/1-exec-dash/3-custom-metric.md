When a customer completes a purchase on Storedog a service called store-cartlogger uses the Datadog API to create a JSON log entry for each item purchased. Here's a formatted example:

```json
{
    "event" : "item_sold",
    "hostname" : "host01",
    "item" : {	
        "cost" : 2.15,
        "id" : "datadog-mug",
        "name" : "Datadog Mug",
        "price" : 13.99
    },
    "service" : "store-cartlogger"
}
```

These log lines contain the amount Storedog paid for the item as `cost`, and the amount Storedog's customer paid for the item as `price`. You can determine the revenue generated by the sale of the item by calculating the difference between these values.

Start by navigating to [Logs Explorer](https://app.datadoghq.com/logs) and searching for `service:store-cartlogger`{{copy}}

Once you’re confident this is the data that will allow you to track revenue, you’re going to want to store that metric over time.

- Create a measure on your **price** and **cost** by clicking on the item and selecting **Create measure for @item.price** and **@item.cost**
- Start by copying your query, `service:store-cartlogger`{{copy}}
- Navigate to **Generate Metrics** under the Logs navigation item
- Select **New Metric**
- Paste your query `service:store-cartlogger`{{copy}}
- Under `Count`, choose one of the measures you just created (`item.price` or `item.cost`)
- Finish by choosing **Create Metric**

Now that you’ve created your metric,
- Select **See in Metric Explorer** by hovering over the metric and clicking the graph icon
- From here you can view your new metric
- Get started with our Executive Dashboard by choosing **Export to existing dashboard**
- Select the name of the screenboard you created earlier (`Store Service Overview`) and click **Export**
