# Creating a Runbook

You just discovered the root cause of an issue in your spree services using advanced dashboarding tools. To capture and share your knowledge, let's create a runbook that you can share with your team.

## Add a Notebook
In your navigation bar, find the Notebook icon and click “New Notebook”, or go to https://app.datadoghq.com/notebook. Give it a name like `Debugging Spree Services`.  
 
Let’s start by adding an overview of your services. You can paste this overview that a teammate has already written.

```
## Service Overview
`ads-service`: Service to manage advertisement scheduling and displays  
`discounts-service`: Service to manage discount codes and validation  
`store-frontend`: Service for the store’s web frontend  
```
