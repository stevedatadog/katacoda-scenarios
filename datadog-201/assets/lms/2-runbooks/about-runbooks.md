Runbooks help members of your team respond to issues by providing them with detailed instructions and historical context. For runbooks to be helpful, team members need them to be accessible and up to date. Because Notebooks are accessible to anyone in your Datadog organization, they make it easy to distribute and collaboratively update runbooks.
