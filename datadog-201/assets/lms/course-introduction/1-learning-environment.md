This lab uses a virtual environment complete with a terminal and IDE. This is where you'll configure applications, run commands, and explore the lab application. The environment will expire after an hour, but the lab is designed to be completed before that happens. At any point you may refresh your browser to reset the lab and start from the beginning.

**Note:** Public URLs to services running in the lab environment will change when the lab restarts. Make sure you're using the newest URLs in your synthetic tests.

This lab also creates or reuses a trial Datadog organization for you so that you can safely explore the Datadog App in isolation of any other organizations you might already use. At the bottom of this page, you will see a **username** and a **password**. These are the trial organization credentials that you should use to login to Datadog for this lab. You don't have to write them down now; we'll display them again inside the interactive lab.

Trial organizations expire every two weeks, but don't worry; we'll automatically create a new trial organization and credentials for you when that happens. This trial organization and its credentials will be reused for every lab in the Learning Center until it expires.
