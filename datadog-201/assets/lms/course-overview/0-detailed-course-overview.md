Take your knowledge to the next level. Now that you've established your baseline knowledge, what's next?

In this course you'll learn a variety of techniques for composing an executive dashboard. This high-level dashboard will display a mix of preset and custom widgets. You'll create custom revenue metrics from logs and a UX SLO from a synthetic browser test.

You will then create a notebook for troubleshooting business critical UX issues. This runbook will use graphs, text, and drilldown links to guide colleagues through diagnosing and resolving application issues.

Along the way, you'll learn techniques and shortcuts that will increase your productivity in everyday Datadog tasks.
