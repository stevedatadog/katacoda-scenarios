In this hands-on section we want to see some of the benefits of tags. Our Kubernetes cluster now has about fifty pods. You will see how tags makes them a bit easier to navigate. From there you will create some dashboards that take advantage of those tags. <br><br>Let's get started. 
  <br><br>**Note:** *The hands-on environments have a lifetime of one hour from the time you first visit. After one hour you will need to refresh the browser to restart them. Each hands-on exercise is a different environment.*
