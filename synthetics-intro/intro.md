In this lab you will learn about the three different types of synthetic tests available in Datadog:

  1. API Tests
  2. Multistep API Tests
  3. Browser Tests

You will create each of these tests to cover an important business function of Storedog, a small e-commerce application. You will configure these tests to run automatically and to alert staff when they fail. This will give the Storedog organization peace of mind as they continue to rapidly enhance and grow their application.
