Now that you have an installed agent on both the host and in Docker, it's time to set up an integration with both Redis and Nginx. Just like before, we are going to do this both in a virtual machine as well as in a Docker container.

The objectives for this sections are:

1. Configure integrations in a traditional virtual machine environment
2. Configure integrations in a container environment
3. Configure the Datadog UI side of integrations
