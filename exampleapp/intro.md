This course uses two different applications that run on this cloud shell. In Getting Started with Logs, we use a simple Flask application with NGINX, an API, a micro-service, and Redis. Each of these services runs in its own Docker container. The Flask application has already been instrumented with Datadog APM and allows us to focus on the log collection and usage part.</p>
