This course uses two different applications that run on this cloud shell. In Getting Started with Logs, we use a simple Flask application with NGINX, an API, a micro-service and Redis running in a few Docker containers. The Flask application has already been instrumented with Datadog APM and allows us to focus on the log collection and usage part.</p>
